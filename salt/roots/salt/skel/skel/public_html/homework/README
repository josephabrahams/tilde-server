Homework Instructions
=====================
Every week, turn in your homework by placing all content into a folder named
after the current week (e.g. week00, week01). Inside that folder should
be the main html file necessary to view your webpage. If there are multiple
html pages, then the first page should be named index.html and all subsequent,
pages should be named after the content contained therein (e.g. about.html,
contact.html).

All assets should be contained in appropriate folders (e.g. css, img, js).
Use relative urls to reference all assets so that placing them in a subdirectory
on the web won't result in broken links.

Please don't use spaces in any files or folders as the command line / URLs don't
play well with spaces.

Example folder structure:

public_html
 |
 |- homework
     |
     |- week03
         |
         |- css
         |   |- normalize.css
         |   |- styles.css
         |
         |- img
         |   |- image01.jpg
         |   |- image02.jpg
         |
         |- index.html
         |- about.html
